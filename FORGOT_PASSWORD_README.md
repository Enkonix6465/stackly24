# Password Reset Implementation

This document describes the simplified password reset functionality implemented for the ShopEase application.

## Overview

The password reset system allows users to reset their passwords when they forget them. It uses a simple approach where users only need to provide their email and new password.

## Features

- **Simple Flow**: No tokens required - just email and new password
- **User Validation**: Ensures user exists before allowing password reset
- **Password Security**: Minimum 6-character password requirement
- **User Experience**: Clean, responsive UI with proper error handling
- **Direct Reset**: Password is updated immediately without additional steps

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `src/pages/forgot-password.tsx` - Password reset page

### Modified Files

- `src/lib/dataService.ts` - Added password reset function
- `src/pages/auth.tsx` - Added "Reset your password?" link
- `src/pages/api/password-reset.ts` - Password reset API endpoint

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/password-reset`

#### Reset Password

```json
{
  "action": "reset",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "newPassword": "newpassword123"
}
```

## Usage Flow

### Password Reset

1. User clicks "Reset your password?" on login page
2. User navigates to `/forgot-password`
3. User enters email and new password
4. User confirms new password
5. System validates email exists and updates password
6. User is redirected to login page

## Security Features

- **User Validation**: Only allows password reset for existing users
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters
- **Email Verification**: Ensures email exists in the system

## Production Considerations

### Security Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for password reset requests
2. **Audit Logging**: Log all password reset attempts
3. **IP Tracking**: Track IP addresses for security monitoring
4. **Email Verification**: Consider requiring email confirmation before reset

### Database Considerations

1. **Password Hashing**: Ensure passwords are properly hashed
2. **Audit Trail**: Keep track of password change history
3. **Indexing**: Add database indexes for email lookups

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Create a user account
2. Navigate to forgot password page
3. Enter email and new password
4. Verify password is updated
5. Verify login works with new password

### Automated Testing

Consider adding tests for:

- Password reset functionality
- User validation
- Password requirements
- Error handling scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Password Reset Fails**:

   - Ensure password meets minimum requirements (6 characters)
   - Verify passwords match in confirmation field
   - Check if email exists in the system
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **User Not Found**:
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Ensure user account exists
   - Check database for user data

### Debug Mode

For development, check:

1. Server logs for error messages
2. Browser console for client-side errors
3. Network tab for API request/response details
4. Database for user data integrity

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Confirmation**: Send confirmation email after password reset
2. **Password History**: Prevent reuse of recent passwords
3. **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout after failed attempts
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for password changes
5. **Security Questions**: Implement security questions as backup

## Support

For issues or questions about the password reset implementation, check:

1. Server logs for error messages
2. Browser console for client-side errors
3. Network tab for API request/response details
4. Database for user data integrity

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This implementation allows anyone with a valid email to reset the password. In production, consider:

1. **Email Verification**: Require email confirmation before allowing password reset
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting reset attempts
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all password reset attempts for security monitoring
4. **IP Restrictions**: Consider restricting password resets from certain IP ranges
5. **Time Delays**: Add delays between reset attempts to prevent brute force attacks
